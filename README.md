# Braavos API

A two-way SMS API built using Lumen, a PHP Framework by Laravel. The app enabled users to request loans by simply sending an SMS.

The app utilises the Africa’s Talking API and the Mpesa API. Records of the app’s activities are stored on a MySQL database.

The API is yet to be deployed.
